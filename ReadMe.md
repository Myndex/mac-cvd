Sim Daltonism for Mac and iOS
===============================

Website: <https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/>

Sim Daltonism is a color blindness simulator for iOS and Mac. It takes a live 
video feed from the camera on iOS and filters it in real time using a color 
blindness simulation algorithm.

The Mac version has a filter window that shows the content underneath the 
window filtered.

The application is almost a clone of [Red Stripe][] where the filter 
algorithm has been replaced with an OpenGL adaptation of the `color_blind_sim`
javascript function found on the [Color Laboratory][]. The video capture and 
live filtering code is taken in part from the [RosyWriter][] sample code
provided by Apple.

This application shares a lot with my other app Red Stripe. Note that contribution accepted in Sim Daltonism will often 
land into Red Stripe too, which is closed source.

### A note about that license

The copyright for the original color blindness simulation algorithm is shared 
by Matthew Wickline and the Human-Computer Interaction Resource Network. It 
seems the HCIRN is not reachable anymore, and it probably no longer exists.
Because of this, Matthew Wickline decided to to change the license to something 
he believed would reflect the original intent of the HCIRN. But it is possible 
that someone still owns the HCIRN copyright, which would make that license 
change legally contestable.

So I am relying solely on the older non-commercial clause for 
distributing this app.

If you distribute a derived work that does not include the color blindness
simulation algorithm derived from `color_blind_sim`, then you only have to
follow the terms of the Apache License 2.0.
